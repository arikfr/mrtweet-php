PHP Wrapper for Mr.Tweet's V1 API
API Doc: http://api.mrtweet.com/v1/docs

It uses libcurl and requires PHP 5 >= 5.2.0 for json_decode.
Of course, you can rewrite to use other json decode funtions (or SimpleXMLElement for the XML response) and something different than libcurl.

While it very straightforward, see MrTweetApiTest.php for example of usage.

Used originally for Topify (http://topify.com/).
